          <h2>Quick Concepts</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>TimebloX</h3>
          <p>This idea came to me while i was hard at work studying. I felt like no focus app gave me
            the satisfaction of actually studying. I tried to think of what simple way i could track my
            focus, so i used a graph paper and filled a square for every 10 minute studied and i really liked 
            the idea!
            <br>
             However, i did not like to have to manually fill a square every 10 minutes, and i knew i was going
            to forget to do it once in a while, thus creating the opposite effect and creating more work instead.
            I designed a simple quick wireframe, and came up with a name that conveyed both the function(tracking time)
             and the unique concept(rewarding a block), TimebloX. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A big inspiration for this was GitHub and how they display the commits on a user's profile, displayed
            as green blocks.
